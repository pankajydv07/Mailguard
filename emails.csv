have already booked a slot and are available on campus, please make sure to
meet me in person at:

*Location:* 4th Floor, Room No. 411, Homi J Bhabha Block (Old Admin Block)

"Dear Students,

I want to remind all students not to skip any training sessions or classes
to attend career counseling sessions.
These training sessions and classes are important for your skill
development and future success, so please prioritize them.

As regular classes are going to commence, I also want to reiterate that
students should not skip their classes to attend counseling sessions.
You can book the slots during your free time or off hours. This should be
strictly followed.

I highly encourage all students to have in-person meetings for career
counseling, as these sessions are more effective and beneficial.

If you have already booked a slot and are available on campus, please make
sure to meet me in person at:

Location: 4th Floor, Room No. 411, Homi J Bhabha Block (Old Admin Block)

If, for any reason, you are unable to meet in person, you can avail the
session online via Google Meet.
However, I prefer in-person meetings for a more interactive and
personalized experience.

Students who have already booked slots are kindly requested to rebook their
slots during non-class hours.

Simply click the link below to schedule a convenient time:

To ensure that our sessions are effective and do not interfere with your
academic schedule, I am canceling all existing appointments.

Please make sure to schedule your appointments during non-class hours and
avoid skipping any classes or training sessions.
